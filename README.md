# EmotiBit_Plugins
Examples and information to make EmotiBit plugins. The intention for this repo is to explain through examples and READMEs how to create algorithms and deploy them in different contexts (python, OF, Arduino, others). This is intended as an instructional repo as it's expected that algorithms will be distributed in many different repos hosted by many different users/organizations.
